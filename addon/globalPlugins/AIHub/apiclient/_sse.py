"""Server-Sent Events line iteration.

Implements the subset of the SSE spec we need:

* ``data:VALUE`` and ``data: VALUE`` are both accepted (Mistral omits the space).
* ``event:``, ``id:``, ``retry:`` and ``:comment`` lines are skipped.
* ``\n``, ``\r\n`` and bare ``\r`` line endings are tolerated.
* Multiple ``data:`` lines forming a single event are joined with ``\n`` per spec.
* Events are dispatched on a blank line.

This module exposes only one public iterator so every stream parser uses the
exact same SSE handling — no more split implementations to keep in sync.
