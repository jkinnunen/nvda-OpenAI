If you want a dedicated desktop experience with additional workflows, see [BasiliskLLM](https://github.com/SigmaNight/basiliskLLM/) (standalone app plus a minimal NVDA add-on). AI Hub remains a full-featured option inside NVDA.

# AI Hub

**AI Hub** is an NVDA add-on that connects your screen reader to multiple large-language-model (LLM) APIs. Use it for writing, summarizing, translation help, vision (images and screenshots), voice questions, transcription, and optional tool dialogs (TTS, OCR, and more)—without leaving NVDA.

The add-on’s **package name** in NVDA is still `openai` (for compatibility with existing installs). The **display name** you see in menus and settings is **AI Hub**.

## Features at a glance

- **Chat** in a dedicated main dialog with history, system prompt, and model/account selection.
- **Images and documents** as attachments from files; **URLs** to remote files with type checks aligned to the **selected provider**.
- **Smart paste** in the prompt field: paste files from the clipboard, paths from text, or a single URL (also available from the prompt’s context menu). `Ctrl+V` uses the same logic when the prompt has focus.
- **Conversation save and history** with rename, delete, and reopen.
- **Ask a question** from anywhere (no default key): assign a gesture in **Input Gestures → AI Hub** to record, send, and hear or read the answer.
- **Global describe**: screenshot (`NVDA+E`) or navigator object region (`NVDA+O`) sent into a chat session.
- **Tools** submenu (under NVDA → AI Hub): provider-specific utilities such as TTS, OCR, speech-to-text, Lyria audio, and Ollama model management.
- **Reasoning / web search** options appear only when the **current model** supports them (varies by provider).

This add-on does **not** include its own update checker. **Updates** are handled through **NVDA’s official Add-on Store** when you install from there. If you install manually from the [releases page](https://github.com/aaclause/nvda-OpenAI/releases), install newer `.nvda-addon` builds the same way.

## Supported providers

Configure **one or more providers** in NVDA **Preferences → Settings → AI Hub**. Each provider can hold **multiple named accounts** (API keys, optional organization or base URL where applicable).

| Provider | Role |
|----------|------|
| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) | GPT and related models; official transcription and TTS tool dialogs |
| [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/) | DeepSeek API (OpenAI-compatible) |
| **Custom OpenAI** | Any OpenAI-compatible HTTP API (custom base URL + key) |
| **Ollama** | Local models via OpenAI-compatible endpoint; model manager tool |
| [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) | Mistral / Pixtral; Voxtral TTS, OCR, and speech-to-text tools |
| [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) | Many third-party models behind one key |
| [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) | Claude |
| [xAI](https://x.ai/) | Grok |
| [Google](https://ai.google.dev/) | Gemini; Lyria 3 Pro tool |

The add-on can pick up API keys from **environment variables** when set (for example `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, and others). The settings UI remains the main place to manage accounts.

### Speech-to-text (transcription) backends

For **microphone / file transcription** inside the main flow (not the separate OpenAI transcription tool), you can choose among **whisper_cpp** (local), **openai** (Whisper API), and **mistral**, under the **Audio** section of AI Hub settings.

## Installation

1. Open the [add-on releases page](https://github.com/aaclause/nvda-OpenAI/releases).
2. Download the latest `.nvda-addon` package.
3. Install it from NVDA’s **Tools → View/manage add-ons** (or open the file from Explorer and confirm installation).

## First-time configuration

1. Open **NVDA → Preferences → Settings**.
2. Select the **AI Hub** category.
3. Under **API keys**, use the buttons for each provider (e.g. **OpenAI API keys…**) to add at least one account: display name, API key, and optional fields (organization, base URL) depending on the provider.
4. Optionally adjust **Audio**, **Chat feedback**, **Advanced** / temperature, and **Auto-save conversation** (enabled by default).

Until at least one provider account is ready, opening the main dialog will prompt you to add keys in AI Hub settings.

## Upgrading from older “Open AI” builds

If you used an older version of this add-on:

- **Settings** are migrated from the legacy **`OpenAI`** config section to **`AIHub`**. You should not lose preferences.
- **Data files** (conversations, keys store, attachments) are migrated from the folder **`openai`** under your NVDA user configuration directory to **`aihub`**.

You do not need to move files manually unless you use a custom setup.

## NVDA menu: AI Hub

Under the NVDA menu you will find **AI Hub** (with the installed version in the label). Entries include:

- **Documentation** — opens the user guide in your browser (`doc\en\readme.html`). **Shipped packages** should include that file; it is **not** edited by hand—generate it from this `readme.md` using your **markdown2html** (or equivalent) conversion step in the build or release pipeline.
- **Main dialog…** — open the chat window (`NVDA+G` by default).
- **Conversation history…** — manage saved chats.
- **Tools** — submenu grouping **OpenAI**, **Mistral**, **Google**, and **Ollama** utilities (see below).
- **API keys** / **API usage** / **GitHub repository** / **BasiliskLLM** — quick links.

## Main dialog

Open with **`NVDA+G`** or **Main dialog…** from the AI Hub menu.

### What you can do

- Chat with the selected model; review **Messages** with keyboard navigation and context menus (e.g. **j** / **k** to move between messages when focus is in the messages area—see on-screen hints for the active field).
- Attach **local images or documents** and add **file URLs** where the provider supports them. Unsupported types for the current provider may be warned before send.
- **Paste (file or text)** from the prompt’s context menu, or **`Ctrl+V`** in the prompt: the add-on may attach files, insert text paths, or treat a single URL as an attachment when appropriate.
- Record **audio** snippets, attach audio files, and use **TTS** for prompt text where the model supports it.
- **`Escape`** closes the main dialog (when no blocking modal is open).
- **`Ctrl+R`** toggles microphone recording (when applicable).
- **`F2`** renames the current saved conversation (after it exists in storage).
- **`Ctrl+N`** opens a **new** main dialog instance (session).

### Options that depend on the model

Some controls only appear or apply for certain models:

- **Reasoning** (“thinking”) for models that expose it; streamed reasoning is kept separate from the visible answer when the API provides that distinction.
- **Reasoning effort** and related controls where the provider supports levels.
- **Web search** only for models that advertise web search support.

Exact availability changes as providers update their APIs; the UI reflects the **currently selected model**.

### System prompt

The system prompt steers model behavior. A default suited to accessibility assistance is provided; you can edit it, reset it from the context menu, and optionally persist the last used prompt (configurable in settings). The system prompt consumes tokens like any other input.

## Conversation history

Use **Conversation history…** from the AI Hub menu, or assign a gesture under **Input Gestures → AI Hub**.

You can list, open, rename, delete, and create conversations. From the main dialog, **F2** and **Ctrl+N** help manage the current session.

### Auto-save

If **Auto-save conversation** is enabled in settings (default), the add-on saves (or updates) the stored conversation **after each completed assistant response**, and may persist state when you close the dialog if there is something to save. You can also save from the **Messages** field context menu. If auto-save is off, use manual save when you want to persist.

## Ask a question (voice)

This command has **no default key**. Assign one under **Input Gestures → AI Hub**.

- First press: start recording.
- Second press while recording: stop and send.
- If the answer is played as audio, press again to stop playback.

**Modes:**

- **Direct audio** — if the selected model supports audio input, your recording can be sent as audio without a separate transcription step.
- **Transcribe then chat** — otherwise the configured transcription backend processes the recording, then the text is sent to the chat model.

If the main dialog is focused, its **current model** is used; otherwise the add-on chooses a suitable model among configured providers.

## Tools submenu

The **Tools** entry under the AI Hub menu opens provider-grouped dialogs (each may require the corresponding API account):

| Menu area | Tool |
|-----------|------|
| Mistral | **Voxtral TTS…**, **OCR…**, **Speech to Text…** |
| Google | **Lyria 3 Pro…** |
| OpenAI | **TTS…**, **Transcription / Translation…** |
| Ollama | **Model manager…** |

If no account is configured for a tool’s provider, the add-on will tell you to add one in AI Hub settings.

## Global commands

All default gestures can be changed in **NVDA → Preferences → Input Gestures → AI Hub**.

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `NVDA+G` | Show the AI Hub main dialog |
| `NVDA+E` | Screenshot and describe (adds image to a session) |
| `NVDA+O` | Describe the current navigator object region |
| *(no default gesture)* | Conversation history. Assign in Input Gestures → AI Hub. |
| *(no default gesture)* | Ask a question (record / send / stop audio). Assign in Input Gestures → AI Hub. |
| *(no default gesture)* | Toggle microphone recording and transcription. Assign in Input Gestures → AI Hub. |

## Where data is stored

Working files, saved conversations index, unified `accounts.json`, and attachments live under your NVDA **user configuration** directory, in the **`aihub`** folder (after migration from `openai`). Temporary files use a `tmp` subfolder and are cleaned up when reasonable (e.g. on add-on termination or dialog close).

## Required dependencies (auto-retrieved during build)

Builds use `scons` to populate runtime libs under:

`addon/globalPlugins/AIHub/libs/`

When a required lib is missing, `scons` downloads pinned wheels and extracts only what is needed into that folder. Current pinned dependencies are:

- **[markdown2](https://pypi.org/project/markdown2/)** `2.5.4` — extracted as `libs/markdown2.py` for chat Markdown rendering.
- **[Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)** `12.1.1` for:
  - Python `3.11` `win32` -> `libs/lib_py3.11_win32/`
  - Python `3.13` `win_amd64` -> `libs/lib_py3.13/`

The `libs` directory is intentionally git-ignored; contributors do not need to commit vendored artifacts.

## Troubleshooting (short)

- **“No account configured”** — Add an API key for the provider you selected in **AI Hub** settings.
- **Provider rejects an attachment** — Check file type and size; try another model or provider that supports the media you need.

For issues and contributions, use the **GitHub repository** link from the AI Hub menu.
